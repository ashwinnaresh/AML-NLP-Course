Morkel to Rahane,  no run,  more respectfully played by Rahane, but a much better delivery by Morkel. Good length on off which is defended into the off side

Rabada to Rahane,  no run,  drifting down leg and the appeal is withdrawn before it gets loud. Good length and Rahane misses out on some runs through leg

Morkel to Rahane,  1 run,  Morkel persists with that back of a length, Rahane sticks to his steer to third man
Morkel to Dhawan,  OUT,  soft dismissal. Loss in concentration there. Slower offcutter outside off, Dhawan just chips the ball to short cover. JP Duminy is surprised as he takes it. But that was a deceitful change in pace from Morkel. After all that pace, he goes slower and full which results in Dhawan going through the stroke much earlier

The batsmen watch that and take one, then Kohli sprints back for the second while Rahane holds his hand up to say no but Kohli wants the run.

Imran Tahir to Kumar,  OUT,  and he has got him this time. Just a little slower through the air and Kumar looks to drive through long-off anticipating some legspin but this one doesn't spin. There is however, a huge gap between bat and pad and the delivery sneaks through and clips leg stump.
Imran Tahir to Harbhajan Singh,  no run,  googly again to begin to Harbhajan, but this one is wide outside off. Driven back to the bowler

Rabada to Dhoni,  no run,  back of a length on middle and leg, Dhoni jumps in his crease but plays the ball to midwicket
Rabada to Dhoni,  FOUR,  too wide this time and Dhoni makes him pay. He hangs back, well inisde his crease and crunches the cut past point
Rabada to Dhoni,  no run,  and another loose delivery. Short and wide, Dhoni cuts again but this time, goes straight to point. Missed opportunity again
Rabada to Dhoni,  no run,  139.5 ks, good length on middle and leg, not a great over this so far. Dhoni shuffles across and tries to get some bat on that but hits his arm and then through to de Kock
Rabada to Dhoni,  no run,  fuller than a good length which maybe deceives Dhoni who was staying back in his crease, expecting a shorter length. The ball pings off his body into the off side. Harbhajan thinks there is one but is sent back by the captain
Morkel to Harbhajan Singh,  no run,  good length on middle, that splice-jarring length. Harbhajan lobs the ball back to Morkel but it lands well short of him

Morkel to Dhoni,  1 run,  Dhoni has now realised the length being bowled to him. He shuffles across and helps the short ball down to fine leg

Morkel to Harbhajan Singh,  no run,  follows-it up with another short delivery on off stump. Harbhajan just cannot connect. Swings at the ball again and comprehensively misses
Duminy to Dhoni,  SIX,  whew. what power. Just plain muscular prowess. Short again from Duminy and Dhoni was waiting for that. He muscles the ball well over long-on. What a shot

Duminy to Harbhajan Singh,  SIX,  oh he has connected with that, alright. No question about it. Tossed up on off from JP and Harbhajan clears one foot and launches a huge six over midwicket. That was just huge.
Duminy to Harbhajan Singh,  no run,  shorter again and no spin, Harbhajan wants to send a message by playing a forward defense but the ball beats him.
Morkel to Dhoni,  1 run,  short and wide, pushed out to the sweeper cover off the back foot

Morkel to Harbhajan Singh,  1 run,  good length again on off, Harbhajan clears one foot and muscles the ball down past mid-off . There is a misfield but they get only one
Morkel to Dhoni,  no run,  not a wide there and rightly so. Dhoni walks well across his stumps trying to tickle the ball to fine leg but the ball misses that leg stump
Morkel to Dhoni,  1 leg bye,  very similar line and length. But this time, the ball meets Dhoni's pads before rolling off to square leg. Morkel is the only one appealing
Morkel to Harbhajan Singh,  1 run,  overpitched outside off and Harbhajan plays a good-looking drive through the vacant cover region. Dhoni slips and therefore just the one
Imran Tahir to Harbhajan Singh,  1 run,  pushed through outside off which is just pushed to cover, Harbhajan lazily jogs through but doesn't realise AB is lurking. He gets his wheels on but the throw isn't accurate

Imran Tahir to Dhoni,  1 wide,  googly down the leg side, huge wide
Imran Tahir to Dhoni,  2 runs,  he wants two immediately and gets it. He plays the topspinner with soft hands towards square leg and hustles back for the second

Morkel to Dhoni,  1 run,  lovely line that with any field. tight on off and Dhoni gets bat on that to point
Morkel to Harbhajan Singh,  1 run,  lands safely. Huge hit attempted by Harbhajan. Full on off and Harbhajan looks to go straight but the ball skews off the outer half of the bat straight in the air but lands behind point. Just the one however
Steyn to Harbhajan Singh,  no run,  shorter length outside off. Good choice. Harbhajan swings at that but misses again
Steyn to Harbhajan Singh,  FOUR,  makes connection here. Slower delivery outside off, Harbhajan goes back and looks to smash the ball over cover and executes nicely
Steyn to Harbhajan Singh,  OUT,  short and extremely sweet from Harbhajan. Good cameo that, but Dhoni will have to farm the strike now. Full outside off, harbhajan swipes at that and gets a thick outside edge which flies to de Kock who clings onto a sharp chance to his right.
Steyn to Yadav,  no run,  back of a length on middle and with that length the top of the bat is in trouble. Hits that area of the bat before going back towards Steyn
Steyn to Yadav,  FOUR,  Yadav takes Steyn on and crashes the short length through midwicket. Made a good sound as it left the bat
Steyn to Yadav,  OUT,  139 ks, and what a catch from de Kock. Only reflex. Yadav chooses a decent shot but doesn't execute well enough in a game of fine margins. Back of a length and Yadav looks to steer the ball to third man with the pace. But the ball goes too fine, de Kock dives to his right and takes a stunning catch. Excellently held.

Rabada to Dhoni,  FOUR,  given six. Great shot from Dhoni. Fullish outside off, and Dhoni chooses his shot really well and the execution is terrific. Launches that well over mid-off. Aleem Dar signals six but that one bounced a foot inside the boundary. And the correction is eventually made.
Rabada to Dhoni,  1 wide,  drifting down leg and another wide
Rabada to Dhoni,  no run,  fuller length on middle, blocked back down the track
Rabada to Dhoni,  1 run,  and Dhoni knows exactly what he is doing as he steals a single off the final ball of the over. Overpitched on middle, a little bit fuller and that would have been a yorker but Dhoni digs the ball out to mid-on and scampers one
Steyn to Dhoni,  no run,  shorter length on off, Dhoni heaves the ball to long-on and he refuses the single again
Steyn to Dhoni,  FOUR,  smears the ball over cover for four. Excellent shot selection but this length is a bit too predictable with the field. Shorter length outside off and just clears mid-off, goes to the boundary
Steyn to Dhoni,  no run,  good length now and Dhoni plays the ball to mid-on. No run again
Steyn to Dhoni,  FOUR,  one-bounce boundary. Attempted bouncer aimed at Dhoni's badge but that one doesn't get up high enough. Dhoni pulls the ball uppishly over square leg for four. Easy four
Steyn to Dhoni,  1 run,  takes the one this time. Fuller than a good length and Dhoni gets bat on it as he pushes the ball to cover for one

Rabada to Dhoni,  no run,  terrific short ball. Dhoni decides against hitting that. Not called wide
Rabada to Dhoni,  SIX,  finally, connects well enough with one. Short again on middle and leg but Dhoni is outside leg, waiting for that. He swings at that and smashes that flat and far. Beats midwicket and destroys a board behind the boundary rope. If any shot had a message to send, that was it.
MM Sharma to Miller, 1 run, back of a length and jags in, Miller is cramped for room a bit but secures a single through square leg to get off the mark

Stalled Kohli throughout the second part of his innings. Take a bow, Russell Domingo and AB de Villiers
Morkel to Rahane, OUT, repeat delivery. Repeat shot. Repeat dismissal. Miller takes this low to the ground, that being the only difference. Banged in short again, Rahane advances and slogs this in the air to deep midwicket. Are these percentage shots? With this consistent length, the batsmen have been found out playing poor shots.

Steyn to Patel, 1 run, what fielding. Deserved a wicket for that piece of fielding. Short on off, flat-batted to Miller at mid-off who dives to his right and makes an amazing stop. He then gets up and fires a throw to the non-striker's end and a direct hit would have had him.
