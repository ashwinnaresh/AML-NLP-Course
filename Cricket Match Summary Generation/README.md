#Cricket Match Summary Generation
In this project, we developed a system capable of generating match summaries given the match commentaries. The commentaries were scraped from ESPN CricInfo and the commentaries dataset was created. Named Entity Recognition was performed on each commentary using a Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Different match events like sixes, fours, wickets etc. were tagged using a MaxEnt model. A Natural Language Generation (NLG) module then generated a match summary based on the outputs of the RNN and MaxEnt Model. I actively contributed to the dataset generation, event tagging and the NLG modules.
