Emotion detection of audio clip :-

Problem 1 :-
--> Dataset generation module was used to prepare the dataset.

Sub system 1 :- 
--> Number of HMMs used :- 2 
--> GMMHMM with 2 hidden states and 1 gaussian mixture. 
--> Efficiency :- 89%

Sub system 2 :- 
--> Number of HMMs used :- 3 
--> GMMHMM with 3 hidden states and 1 gaussian mixture. 
--> Efficiency :- 80%

Sub system 3 :- 
--> Number of HMMs used :- 2 
--> GMMHMM with 2 hidden states and 1 gaussian mixture. 
--> Efficiency :- 91.5%

Duration for which shouting was detected :-
--> File :- arvind_9.wav :- {Arvind Kejriwal :- 35 seconds (100%)}
--> File :- host5.wav :- {Arnab :- 3 seconds (13.8 %)}

Observation :- Due to less number of training examples for "Arnab shouting", the HMM could not recognize instances when Arnab was actually shouting. This led to a decreased accuracy when wav files of Arnab were tested.

Total efficiency of the combined system :- 86.83%
