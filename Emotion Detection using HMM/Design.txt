Problem 1 :-
For subsystem 1,
2 continuous HMMs each capable of detecting shouting and not shouting people were built using the hmmlearn library. 
Output layer returned the argmax of the output probabilities given by the 2 HMMs.
Number of hidden states - 2
Reason - 
We considered that every observable can transition among 2 states identified by single person speaking and multiple people speaking.

Number of Gaussian mixtures per GMM - 1
Reason - 
The given problem was trivial enough to be represented by 1 Gaussian distribution/bell curve.

For subsystem 2,
3 continuous HMMs each capable of detecting Arnab, Arvind and Ravish speaking were built using the hmmlearn library. 
Output layer returned the argmax of the output probabilities given by the 3 HMMs.
Number of hidden states - 3
Reason - 
We considered that every observable can transition among 3 states identified by Arnab speaking, Kejriwal speaking and Ravish speaking.

Number of Gaussian mixtures per GMM - 1
Reason - 
The given problem was trivial enough to be represented by 1 Gaussian distribution/bell curve.

For subsystem 3,
2 continuous HMMs each capable of detecting single and mutliple people speaking were built using the hmmlearn library. 
Output layer returned the argmax of the output probabilities given by the 3 HMMs.
Number of hidden states - 2
Reason - 
We considered that every observable can transition among 2 states identified by single and multiple people speaking.

Number of Gaussian mixtures per GMM - 1
Reason - 
The given problem was trivial enough to be represented by 1 Gaussian distribution/bell curve.
